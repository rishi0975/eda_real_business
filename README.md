<h1><strong>Problem Statement - I</strong></h1>

<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>

This assignment applies EDA in a business scenario. You will use EDA techniques and understand risk analytics in banking to minimize the risk of loan defaults.

<h2><strong>Business Understanding</strong></h2>

Loan providers struggle to give loans due to insufficient credit histories. Your task is to use EDA to ensure applicants capable of repaying loans are not rejected.

Two risks for loan approval:
- Loss of business if the applicant can repay the loan.
- Financial loss if the applicant defaults.

The data includes:
- Clients with payment difficulties.
- Clients who pay on time.

Loan decisions:
- Approved
- Cancelled
- Refused
- Unused offer

Use EDA to understand how attributes influence loan default tendencies.

<h2><strong>Business Objectives</strong></h2>

Identify patterns indicating loan default to guide decisions such as denying loans or adjusting interest rates. Understand key variables driving defaults for risk assessment.
